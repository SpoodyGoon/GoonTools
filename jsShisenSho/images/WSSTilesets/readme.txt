1. What is this?
----------------

These are some extra tilesets for ShisenSho for Windows. With these sets you can
customize the look of the game's tiles. The tilesets are compatible with any version
of ShisenSho for Windows.


2. Where to get?
----------------

You can download the ZIP package from SourceForge.net at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/winshisen/files/Tilesets

The package contains the following files:

    Blue Glass.bmp
    Brown Glass.bmp
    Burgundy Glass.bmp
    By Hand.bmp
    Egyptian.bmp
    Electron.bmp

    readme.txt
    Runes.bmp

3. How to install?
------------------

For ShisenSho versions prior to 0.3.0, unpack the files to <Program Folder>\tilesets,
e.g. C:\Program Files\ShisenSho\tilesets.

For ShisenSho 0.3.0, unpack the files into one of the following folders:
<Program Folder>\tilesets                   - to make them available to all users.
                                              The will get deleted on game uninstallation!
<All User's Documents>\ShisenSho\tilesets   - to make them available to all users.
                                              The files will be kept on game uninstallation.
<My Documents>\ShisenSho\tilesets           - to make them available only to that user.
                                              The files will be kept on game uninstallation.


In the game's main window, select Options->Setup Shisen-Sho from the menu, click the
Tileset tab, select a tileset, and click OK.

You don't need to restart the game after installing new tilesets, if it's already running.


4. How to uninstall?
--------------------

Simply delete the files from the folder you unpacked them into.

----------

The tilesets "Egyptian", "Electron", "Marble", and "Runes" where not made by myself. I
just modified them a little bit to make them look better or make them compatible with
ShisenSho for Windows, respectively.

A few years ago, they could have been downloaded from kde.org or from a site they linked
to, I don't remember what it actually was. I also don't remember who the artists were
but I do know, they released it under the GPL. The license was not included in the
download, though.

My credit goes to the original artists of these tilesets. Thanks for your work! If I
violate any copyrights by re-releasing and/or modifying your work, please contact me by

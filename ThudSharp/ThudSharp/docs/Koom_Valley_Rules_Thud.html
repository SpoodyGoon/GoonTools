<h1>A Game</h1>
<p>Every Koom Valley Day dwarfs and trolls from around the Disc
gather
at the original site of the battle. But this is not for any feeble
re-enactment but another serious attempt to settle old scores.</p>
<p>On this occasion the dwarfs are trying to escape from Koom
Valley
with the Rock. They believe that one of the ancient magical talking
cubes they have been seeking for years is hidden in it.</p>
<p>The trolls are trying to stop them, not because they know what
may
be in the Rock, but because they object to the dwarfs removing any
large lump of stone, which may indeed, be some troll's grandfather
having a bit of a quiet think.</p>
<h2>Object of the game.</h2>
<p>For the dwarfs to win they must move the rock to the far side
of the
valley (shown in dark grey on the layout diagram below). Ie onto any of
the five squares on the opposite side of the board against which the
dwarf commander is sitting. For the trolls to win they must capture the
rock by placing three trolls adjacent to it (in any direction including
diagonally). If neither side can achieve their objective the game is
drawn.</p>

<h2>Equipment.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Thud board.</li>
<li>Eight trolls (T).</li>
<li>Sixteen dwarfs (D).</li>
<li>The Rock (R).</li>
</ul>
<h1>DWARF COMMANDER</h1>
<h2>Moves</h2>
<p>Dwarfs have the first move.</p>
<p>A troll may be moved one, two or three squares in any straight
line,
horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A dwarf may move any distance
in a straight line, horizontally, vertically or diagonally. No piece
may jump over any other piece including the rock. The Rock may only be
moved by the dwarfs (instead of moving a dwarf piece). It may move only
one square in any direction. To be moved it must be next to a dwarf and
it must also be next to a dwarf at the end of its move.</p>
<h2>Captures</h2>
<p>A troll captures a dwarf by trampling over it. It moves in a
straight line from a square next to the dwarf, through the square the
dwarf is on and lands on the empty square immediately beyond. The
trampled dwarf is removed from the board.</p>
<p>Several captures may be made in one move and a change of
direction is allowed between captures.</p>
<p>Dwarfs capture a troll by moving a dwarf so that the troll is
trapped between two dwarfs in any straight line (including diagonally).
The three pieces, two dwarfs and a troll, must all be in line.</p>
<p>If the dwarf that has been moved also traps another troll
between itself and another dwarf, that troll is also captured.</p>
<p>The rock plays no part in any captures.</p>
<p>A piece may safely be moved to come to rest between two
opposing
pieces. Captures are only made when the capturing side moves a piece.
The rock may be moved and come to rest next to three trolls. <em>It
can only be captured when a troll is moved.</em></p>
<p>Captures are not compulsory.</p>

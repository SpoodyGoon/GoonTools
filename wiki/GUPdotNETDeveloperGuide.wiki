== <font color="#003366">Overview</font> ==

GUPdotNET has been designed to be a simple, stand alone update tool for Mono/Gtk# applications. It started out as an attempt to be a clone of the gup (general purpose updater) used by Notepad++ and grew from there. There may be features added in the future there will be a focus on keeping GUPdotNET as small, easy to configure and cross platform as possible.

Not all features will be available in version 1.0 due to time constraints, testing issues, etc. any feature and/or item with a [http://brdstudio.net/gupdotnet/unsupported.png] by is intended to be implemented in version 1.1 but there may be surprises.

=== <u><i>Local System</i></u> ===

Local system configuration, also referred to as "program info", takes place in the application config file (GUPdotNET.exe.config) that resides in the same folder that GUPdotNET does. This is a commonly used method for managing settings for .NET applications and can be changed at by anyone with write permissions to the containing directory.

|| DebugMode || Debug mode is used during development, it changes the where user settings are saved and in some cases writes out additional runtime information for testing and debugging. || 
|| ErrorLog || When turned on application errors will be written to the user application data directory. || 
|| UpdateLog || When turned on detailed information like when an update check is performed or an installer is downloaded, is written to a log in the user application directory. || 

==== Program Info <i><font size=1>(Loaded from GUPdotNET app.config)</font></i> ==== 
|| *Name* || *Description* ||
|| UpdateFileName || The file name of the program that is being supported by GUPdotNET, the program must be present in the same directory as GUPdotNET. || 
|| UpdatePackageURL || The remote web site address for the package configuration file, that contains informatin on the most recent application updates. ||

=== <u><i>Remote System</i></u> ===

Remote system configuration, also referred to as "package info", is located on a web server that is publicly accessible and contains information that relates to the most recent updates to the application that is supported by GUPdotNET. The package configuration is a static xml file that is pulled from the web site and used to determine if a newer version of the supported application is available. The package file is intended to contain update information for multiple operating systems and install methods.
